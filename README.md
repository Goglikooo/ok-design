## 🎨 Design Approach

This project was designed and developed as a complete digital product:

- Visual identity and layout designed from scratch  
- Emphasis on readability, whitespace, and project presentation  
- Clear content hierarchy for client communication  
- Subtle motion and interaction to keep the experience calm and professional  

The goal was to balance **aesthetic quality** with **technical reliability**.
